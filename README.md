<h3 align="left">About:</h2>

---
A prototype developed to determine if a patient should be diagnosed with heart disease or not, which is a binary outcome.<br>
Attributes - age,  gender,  cholesterol,  chest  pain  type,  thalach,  resting  blood pressure, etc<br>
Machine learning approaches  - Logistic  Regression,  K-nearest  neighbors,  naive  baiyes,  support  vector machine, random forest, and decision tree, etc<br>
Comparing to find the best.<br>
Dataset - kaggle.<br>
Trained models using 5 different machine learning algorithms and eventually compared them to find the one with the best accuracy, Logistic Regression algorithm 
provided the better accuracy i.e., 84% accurate for training data and 86% accurate for the testing data.<br>
comparison_of_algorithms.py file contains various models and represents it in graph form

<h3 align="left">Purpose:</h2>

---

Cardiovascular disease(CVD) is increasing daily in this modern world. According to the World Health Organization(WHO), an estimated 17 million people die each year from cardiovascular disease, particularly heart attacks and strokes.<br> 
It is, therefore, necessary to record the most important symptoms and health habits that contribute to CVD and take precautionary measures from the start.<br>
This prototype was developed as a capstone project for the subject pbl(Project Based Learning) of my Fifth Semester of B.E. in Information Technology <br>
I undertook this project as I wanted to gain better understanding of Machine Learning Algorithms as well as of Python and MongoDB.
